How to make it work:

   1. Create a separate directory and download all these files into the same directory
   2. Download the following 2 files: 
			 1) SGD_PMF.py: Main file for training PMF
          2) u.data: MovieLens 100k data set
   3. Run SGD_PMF.py

I did not try to optimize this code, but please e-mail me if you find bugs.
I am also very glad to communicate with you by e-mail about your problems.
